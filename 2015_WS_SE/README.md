# Software Engineering

Undergrad lecture at the Reutlingen University in the winter term 2015.

In the winter term 2015/16 the project is to develop is a [battleship clone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_%28game%29). The basic game rules provide a minimum set of requirements, which can be freely modified or extended by the students.

I use the BattleShip clone in this github/cdeck3r/BattleShip to play around with some software technologies.
